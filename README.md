# Applay-GLCM-on-FMD-data
Use GLCM(also known as the gray-level spatial dependence matrix) to make Texture Analysis,The GLCM functions characterize the texture of an image by calculating how often pairs of pixel with specific values and in a specified spatial relationship occur in an image, creating a GLCM, and then extracting statistical measures from this matrix. (The texture filter functions, described in Calculate Statistical Measures of Texture cannot provide information about shape.
These statistics provide information about the texture of an image (Contrast-Correlation-Energy-Homogeneity)
